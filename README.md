Hello Dr. Green. I hope you're having a lovely day. This is the README file for this project.

The languages needed to run this project are: Either Python 2.7.1 or Python 3.5 and Pygame. The links to download both have been added below.

Description: I will be attempting to use python, and hopefully pygame (extra credit points?!) to create a GUI based program on a 30fps clock with I/O to graphically show the different encoding properties. Output of the clock speeds will be displayed in realtime on the window title. I will be using photoshop as well to create (hopefully) a nice background and buttons to switch between screens.
