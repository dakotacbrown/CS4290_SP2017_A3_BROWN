Hello Dr. Green. I hope you're having a lovely day. This is the README file for this project.

The languages needed to run this project are: Either Python 2.7.1 or Python 3.5 and Pygame. The links to download both have been added below.

Description: I used python and pygame (extra credit points?!) to create a GUI based program on a 30fps clock with I/O to graphically show the different encoding properties. To see a display of the output, press and hold one of the buttons, and it will be displayed near the bottom of the screen. Output of the clock speed is displayed in realtime as the window title. I used photoshop as well to create backgrounds and buttons to switch between the screens. For a file to be read, change the file name to "file.txt".
