Hello Dr. Green. I hope you're having a lovely day. This is the README file for this project.

The languages needed to run this project are: Either Python 2.7.1 or Python 3.5 and Pygame. The links to download both have been added below.

Description: I used python and pygame to create a GUI based program on a 30fps clock with I/O to graphically show the different encoding properties. To see a display of the output, press and hold one of the buttons, and it will be displayed near the bottom of the screen. Output of the clock speed is displayed in realtime as the window title. I used photoshop as well to create backgrounds and buttons to switch between the screens. For a file to be read, change the file name to "file.txt".

Python: https://www.python.org/
Pygame: http://www.pygame.org/lofi.html

S/N: I was not able to complete the gaphical output as I would have liked to do due to having to travel to a funeral. It is still in the program as the randomWaves method if you would like to look at it.
